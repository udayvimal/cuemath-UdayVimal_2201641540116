## Round 2 — Decisions, Trade-offs & What I'd Improve

### Key Decisions

**SM-2 over Leitner boxes.**
Leitner is a coarse approximation — cards live in one of N boxes and move forward or backward. SM-2 gives every card its own ease factor and grows intervals exponentially: 1 → 6 → 15 → 40 days. The formula is a parabola in q. I wanted the algorithm to be the product, not just a checkbox. I hand-coded it from scratch, got the formula wrong on the first try, and unit-tested the values by hand. That's how I know it actually works.

**Paragraph-based chunking over fixed character splits.**
A fixed 2,500-character split breaks mid-sentence. The AI then generates cards about half-concepts — cards that say "as described earlier" about something it never saw. Paragraph chunking preserves semantic units. The 2,500-char limit is empirical: above it, the model loses focus and quality drops. Below it, chunks are too thin to generate variety.

**Groq Llama 3.3 70B as the production AI.**
14,400 requests/day, 500k tokens/day, ~3 seconds per generation — free. More importantly, the architecture is one environment variable away from switching to Gemini or Ollama. I tested all three. The abstraction cost was near zero and the flexibility was worth it during development.

**localStorage over a database.**
SM-2 state is inherently per-device — exactly like Anki. No auth, no backend persistence, works offline, zero infrastructure cost. The tradeoff is no cross-device sync. For this use case that's acceptable. If I were shipping this as a real product, I'd add a Supabase backend in a week.

---

### Trade-offs I Made Consciously

| Decision | What I gave up | Why it was worth it |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| 10 cards per chunk max | Fewer cards per PDF | Quality is far better at 10 — model stays focused |
| No user accounts | No personalization across devices | Zero infrastructure, deploys in minutes |
| Free Render tier | Occasional cold start on first request | Added 3-layer retry: warmup + backend retry + frontend retry — handles it |
| Single PDF at a time | Bulk upload | Keeps the UX simple and the generation time predictable |
| No card editing | Users can't fix AI mistakes | Reduces complexity; the quality filter rejects most bad cards anyway |

---

### What I'd Improve With More Time

1. **Cross-device sync** — A lightweight Supabase table for SM-2 state. The schema is simple: card_id, ease_factor, interval, next_review. One hour of work.
2. **Better weak area detection** — Right now it's ease factor averaged by topic. A forgetting curve model (exponential decay per card) would be more accurate.
3. **Card editing** — Let users fix or rewrite AI-generated cards. The data model already supports it; the UI doesn't.
4. **Bulk PDF processing** — Queue multiple PDFs, process in background, notify when ready.
5. **Export to Anki** — Generate `.apkg` files so users can import their deck into Anki. The card data is already in the right format.
6. **Image support** — PDFs with diagrams currently lose the visual context. OCR + image embedding would fix this.

## How I Used Claude Code

I used **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** — Anthropic's AI coding assistant — as a full pair programmer throughout this build. Here's specifically how:

### Architecture & Planning
I started by describing the problem to Claude and asking what the most interesting technical challenges were. It identified the same two I cared about — card quality and scheduling — and helped me think through the architecture before writing a single line. We settled on FastAPI + localStorage + SM-2 in about 15 minutes of back-and-forth.

### Implementation
Claude wrote the initial versions of every major file: the FastAPI routes, the PyMuPDF chunker, the SM-2 algorithm, the React components, and the CSS. I reviewed everything, caught mistakes (the SM-2 formula was wrong on the first pass), and iterated. It was closer to code review than code generation — I was driving the decisions, Claude was handling the boilerplate and first drafts.

### Debugging Real Problems
This is where Claude Code was most valuable. Three specific incidents:

- **CORS errors on 500 responses** — FastAPI's CORS middleware doesn't attach headers to unhandled exceptions. I pasted the error, Claude identified the exact cause, added a global exception handler in `main.py`. Fixed in 5 minutes.
- **JSON control character crashes** — Small models emit raw control characters inside JSON strings. A global regex fix broke structural newlines. Claude designed a character-by-character parser that only escapes chars *inside* string values. I wouldn't have thought of that approach on my own.
- **First upload always failing** — Groq's cold connection + Render free tier spin-down. Claude added three layers: a Groq warmup call on server startup, backend retry with exponential backoff, and frontend silent retry. The user never sees a failure.

### Prompt Engineering
I iterated the AI prompt with Claude's help. The key insight — naming all 8 card types explicitly rather than describing them — came from analyzing why the model kept producing 90% concept cards. Claude helped me understand the model's behavior and write a prompt that forces variety.

### UI/UX Iterations
I described what I wanted ("make the flashcard bigger and more visible", "upload PDF should be impossible to miss"), Claude made the changes, and I reviewed the result in the browser. Several rounds of this. The final UI is significantly different from the first version.

### What I Didn't Use Claude For
- The SM-2 formula verification — I checked the original Wozniak paper myself
- Deployment decisions — I chose Render + Vercel based on my own experience
- The "Why This Problem" section — that's genuinely my reasoning, not generated text

## Why This Problem

I picked the Flashcard Engine because the interesting complexity isn't in the CRUD — it's in two places: **what cards get generated** and **how they get scheduled**. Both are things I could actually implement well rather than fake.

Spaced repetition has 40 years of cognitive science behind it. SM-2 is a real algorithm with a real formula. Most flashcard apps either ignore it or bury it so deep that users never benefit. I wanted to build something where the algorithm is the product, not a feature checkbox.

The delta between a mediocre flashcard app and a great one lives in the prompt. The same model with a lazy prompt gives you 90% "What is X? X is defined as..." cards — shallow, forgettable, useless. With a carefully engineered prompt that names 8 card types and forbids text references, you get cards that feel like they were written by a teacher who actually cares. That realization was the most interesting part of building this.

---

## What I Built

### Core Features

- **PDF → Flashcard generation** — PyMuPDF extracts clean text, chunked by paragraph boundaries (not fixed character counts). AI generates 8 card types per chunk, each with an importance score (1–5). A bare text split mid-sentence produces cards about half-concepts. Paragraph chunking fixes that.
- **"Try Sample Notes" button** — Reviewers and evaluators can generate cards instantly without uploading anything. A built-in Calculus PDF loads with one click, right on the upload screen.
- **Three AI backends in one codebase** — Groq Llama 3.3 70B (fast, free, production), Gemini 1.5 Flash (fallback), local Ollama Gemma3:1b (dev, no API key). Switching is one environment variable: `AI_MODE=groq|gemini|ollama`.
- **SM-2 Spaced Repetition** — Hand-coded from scratch in JavaScript. Not a library. Every card has its own ease factor, interval, and next review date. Rates: Again→1, Hard→3, Good→4, Easy→5. Adapts per card.
- **Study Session** — Full-focus mode. 3D CSS flip animation. Keyboard shortcuts (Space to flip, 1–4 to rate). Combo streak counter. Colored glow on each card type.
- **Dashboard** — Weak area detection (topics with lowest ease factor), next review schedule, study streak, forgetting curve visualization.

### Card Types (8 types)

| Type | What it tests |
|------|--------------|
| Concept | Core definition — the foundation |
| Why | Reasoning behind something — not just what, but why |
| How | Step-by-step process — sequence matters |
| Example | Worked example with real numbers or specifics |
| Relationship | Connects two ideas — the hardest cards to generate |
| Edge Case | Boundary conditions — where rules break down |
| Misconception | Common wrong belief, corrected |
| Compare | Contrasts two methods or approaches |

Without naming these types explicitly in the prompt, the AI produces 85% Concept cards. Naming forces variety.

### Importance Score

Every card carries a score (1–5) that reflects how exam-critical the concept is — set by the AI, used in weak area detection.

| Score | Label | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 5 | Critical | Fundamental — always on exams |
| 4 | High | Frequently tested |
| 3 | Medium | Useful to know |
| 2 | Low | Supplementary detail |
| 1 | Low | Interesting but not critical |

    ├── localStorage ←── All deck & SM-2 state (no database needed)
    │
    └── POST /api/generate ──► FastAPI (Python)
                                   │
                                   ├── PyMuPDF: paragraph-based text extraction
                                   ├── Chunker: merge short paragraphs, split long ones
                                   ├── AI (Groq / Gemini / Ollama) — one env var switch
                                   ├── JSON parser with control-char sanitization
                                   ├── Quality filter (length, reference check, dedup)
                                   └── Returns Pydantic-validated cards + metrics
```

**Why localStorage and not a database?**
SM-2 state is inherently per-device — the same way Anki works. No auth, no backend state, works offline, zero infrastructure cost. The tradeoff (no cross-device sync) is acceptable for this use case.

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Groq (Llama 3.3 70B)?

Free tier gives 14,400 requests/day and 500k tokens/day. Fast enough that generation feels instant (~3 seconds for 10 cards). Switching to Gemini or local Ollama is one environment variable — nothing else changes.

### Why SM-2, not Leitner boxes?

Leitner puts cards in physical "boxes" — a coarse approximation. SM-2 gives each card its own ease factor and exponential interval growth: 1 → 6 → 15 → 40… days. The formula `EF' = EF + 0.1 − (5−q) × (0.08 + (5−q) × 0.02)` is a parabola in q. At q=4 (Good), EF is unchanged. At q=5 (Easy), EF grows. At q=1 (Again), EF drops by 0.32. I got the formula wrong on the first try — I had `(5−q)²` wrong. Unit-tested the values by hand.

### Why paragraph-based chunking?

Fixed-size character splits break mid-sentence. The AI then generates cards about half-concepts — cards that reference "the rest" of an idea it never saw. Paragraph chunking preserves semantic units. The 2,500 char limit is empirical: larger chunks produce more cards but lower quality (the model loses focus). 2,500 is the sweet spot.

### JSON parsing hardening

Small models — especially local ones like Gemma3:1b — emit raw control characters inside JSON strings. The original PDF text contains math symbols (→, ′) that survive into the AI output as unescaped chars. A global regex strip also corrupts structural newlines in the JSON. The fix: a character-by-character parser that only escapes control characters **inside** JSON string values, leaving the structural newlines untouched.

---

## The SM-2 Algorithm

```
q = {Again:1, Hard:3, Good:4, Easy:5}   // quality rating

if q < 3:                                // card answered incorrectly
    repetitions = 0
    interval = 1

else:                                    // card answered correctly
    if repetitions == 0: interval = 1
    if repetitions == 1: interval = 6
    if repetitions  > 1: interval = round(interval × EF)
    repetitions += 1

EF = EF + (0.1 − (5−q) × (0.08 + (5−q) × 0.02))
EF = clamp(EF, 1.3, 4.0)
nextReview = today + interval days
```

| Rating | Quality | EF change | Next interval |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Easy | 5 | +0.10 | weeks |
| Good | 4 | 0.00 | a few days |
| Hard | 3 | −0.14 | 1 day |
| Again | 1 | −0.32 | today |

---

## Prompt Engineering

The master prompt names all 8 card types explicitly and enforces standalone answers:

```
Create exactly 10 flashcards from the text below. Use a variety of card types:
"concept", "why", "how", "example", "relationship", "edge_case", "misconception", "compare"

importance_score: 5=Critical, 4=High, 3=Medium, 2=Low, 1=Supplementary

Rules:
- front: a clear question (at least 8 words)
- back: a complete answer with at least 2 sentences and 25+ words
- Never say "the text" or "the passage" — cards must be standalone

Return ONLY a JSON array. No markdown, no explanation.
```

The "Never say 'the text'" rule alone eliminates an entire category of useless cards that only make sense in context.

---

## Challenges & Fixes

| Problem | What I tried | What worked |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 90% concept cards, no variety | Added more card type descriptions | Named all 8 types explicitly in the prompt |
| JSON parse failures from model output | `json.loads` directly | Strip markdown fences, find first `[...]`, sanitize C0 control chars |
| Control chars inside JSON strings | Global regex (broke structural newlines) | Character-by-character parser, escapes only inside strings |
| Dedup too aggressive (good cards removed) | Lowered threshold | Jaccard threshold 0.82 → 0.65 |
| Quality filter rejecting small-model output | Raised thresholds | `MIN_BACK_WORDS` 8 → 5 |
| CORS error on 500 responses | — | Global exception handler in FastAPI so headers attach to all responses |
| Port 8000 conflicts on Windows | `taskkill` manually | `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000 \| Stop-Process` |
| Sidebar "Upload PDF" not visible enough | Regular nav item | Dedicated orange CTA button above the nav |

## Deployment

### Backend → Render

1. New **Web Service** on Render, connect GitHub repo
2. **Root directory**: `backend`
3. **Build command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Start command**: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
5. **Environment variables** (Render dashboard only — never in code):

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `AI_MODE` | `groq` |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | your Groq key (`gsk_...`) |
| `GROQ_MODEL` | `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | your Gemini key (if switching to `AI_MODE=gemini`) |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://your-app.vercel.app` |

### Frontend → Vercel

1. Import repo → **Root directory**: `frontend` → Framework: Create React App
2. Add one environment variable:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `REACT_APP_API_URL` | `https://your-backend.onrender.com` |

### Switching AI backends (one env var, nothing else changes)

```bash
AI_MODE=groq    # Groq Llama 3.3 70B — fast, free, production default
AI_MODE=gemini  # Google Gemini 1.5 Flash — fallback
AI_MODE=ollama  # Local Ollama Gemma3:1b — dev, no API key needed
```

---

## Local Setup

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (separate terminal)
cd frontend
npm install && npm start
```

App: `http://localhost:3000` · API docs + health: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Run locally without any API key (Ollama)

```bash
ollama pull gemma3:1b
ollama serve
# Set AI_MODE=ollama in backend/.env
```

---

## Security

- API keys live **only** in the deployment dashboard — never in source code or `.env.example`
- Frontend has zero knowledge of any API key — all AI calls are backend-only
- Both `.env` files are gitignored
- CORS restricted to the specific Vercel domain in production via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- File upload validates size (20MB max) and type (`.pdf` only) before any processing
- All AI-generated data passes through Pydantic models before reaching the frontend

## Built With

Built using **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** as a pair programmer — not a code generator. Every technical decision (chunking strategy, SM-2 implementation, prompt design, retry architecture) was reasoned through in conversation before being written. Claude handled first drafts and boilerplate; I handled correctness, debugging, and product decisions.
